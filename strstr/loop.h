/* Basic string search loop. String functions are implemented by including this file inside corresponding function.
    
  This loop matches string in local variable 
  s                 string to match

  LOOP_TEST(so,sn)  You are given vector sn consisting of consecutive sequence of bytes 
                    from string s. You should return an vector. This vector determines following:
                    For bytes with highest bit set to 1 a loop invokes macro
                    LOOP_BODY(p) where p is position of corresponding byte.
                    See string/vector.h for vector expression description.
  LOOP_BODY(p)      see above
  
  
  You can handle terminating condition by defining
  DETECT_END        When address in local variable s_end is reached LOOP_END(s_end) is called.
  DETECT_ZERO_BYTE  When zero byte is reached LOOP_END(p) is called
  LOOP_END(p)       see above

  When you match multibyte pattern then to also handle ending condition you should set bytes that correspond 
  to end of your pattern. 

  PHASE2            More lowlevel matching can be done by defining PHASE2 macro
                    You can access vectors sn0,sn1,sn2,sn3 with input and modify mvec0,mvec1,mvec2,mvec3
                    with results of LOOP_TEST. 
  PHASE2_SHORT      As phase2 except only mvec0 is relevant. 
             
performance can be improved by       
  SHORT_START       do 
  PREFETCH x        prefetch address 64*x after current address if implementation supports it.
